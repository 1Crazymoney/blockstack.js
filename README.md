# blockchain-id-auth-js

Note: This library is not yet ready for use. We are currently in the process of porting code over from the python implementation:

https://github.com/blockstack/blockchain-id-auth-python

If you'd like to play around with a working version, that's the best place to go.

P.S. if you'd like to assist out with porting this over, feel free to just dig in - your help would be greatly appreciated.
