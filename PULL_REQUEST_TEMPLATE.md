Example:
*As a Blockstack developer, I would like to encrypt files using the app private key. This is needed because storing unencrypted files is unacceptable. This pull request adds the* `*encryptContent*` *function which will take a string and encrypt it using the app private key.

```
encryptContent('my data')

// Running the above should result in the following encrypted data object
